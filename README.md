# Requiem UO Interactive Map

A simple map designed to show players the diverse map of Requiem.

## Roadmap:

1. Create a basic map file. _9/23/17_ 

2. Use tiles to lessen resource load on the map itself.

3. Add in markers detailing Point's of Interests (POI) for players and add them to a separate layer.

4. Create zones indicating the provinces and areas of the map and add them to their own map layer.

5. Add styling, logo's, and other resources for final implementation.

6. Integrate into 13thrones.com.
